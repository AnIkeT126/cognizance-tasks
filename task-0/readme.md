So, this task was about installing Ubuntu in my local system. Luckily for me, I  watched some YouTube tutorials highlighting what problems one might face while dual booting and installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 10. I was intending to keep both Windows10 and Ubuntu Linux and hence the dual boot.
After spending some time on what to do and more specifically how to do I managed to install this on my system.
[THIS](https://youtu.be/eHBLDIwKMFE) video helped me in doing so!
