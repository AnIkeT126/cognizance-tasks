This was a challenging, albeit an interesting task. The very first step was *calling the Github API* for which 
I used the **PyGitHub** library to help me manage the *GitHub* resources in the python code and [this](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/blob/master/README.md)
was what I referred to. I had to generate a Personal Access Token to deal with the authentication issues. 
I did get sidetracked for a while with the *perceval backends* after reading [this](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/blob/master/perceval/git.md).

Another error that I encountered was that my commits were being fetched but were not stored in a .**json** file for which I had to locate the path of a folder using *--git -path _location where I inteded to create the json file*.
At the end I did manage to send Sir Perceval on a successful quest.
