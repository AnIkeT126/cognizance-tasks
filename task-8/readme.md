# **CS50**

In this task we were supposed to watch lectures related to C and work on CS-50 IDE.

To watch the lectures I referred [this](http://cs50.tv/2017/fall/#about,lectures).  Although I have to work on CS50 IDE which I haven't yet because I was not ready to work on a completely new IDE owing to work load that I already have. I plan to work on that, later in this semester.
