        <div id=box>
             Pollution of land and water has affected plants, animals and
                human beings. The quality of soil is deterionating resulting in the loss of agricultural land.
                The loss is estimated to be about five to seven million hectares of land each year. Soil
                erosion, as a result of wind and/or water, costs the world dearly. The recurring floods have
                their own peculiar casualties like deforestation, silt in the river bed, inadequate and improper
                drainage, loss of men and property. The vast oceans, after being turned in to dumping
                grounds for all nuclear wastes, have poisoned and polluted the whole natural environment.

                <br>
                <div id="box4">Population growth means more people to eat and breathe, and
                    putting an excessive pressure on land and forest, and ultimately disturbing the ecological
                    balance.Our growing population is putting pressure on land, leading to poor quality of productivity,
                    deforestation (the loss of forest land so necessary for ecological balance and exitinction of
                    wild life leading to imbalance in the ecological order, loss of wild life heritage and ultimately
                    dwindling of several species. The growing population is not only a problem for the natural
                    environment; it is a problem for any other aspect of environment, say, for example social,
                    economic, political etc.</div>
                <br>
                    <div id="box">Urbanization is no less a source of pollution, and therefore, a threat to
                    the environment. Urbanization means maddening race of people from villages to the cities.
                    The net result of urbanization is dirt, disease and disasters. In a state of growing urbanization,
                    environmental problem like sanitation, ill-heath, housing, water-supply and electricity keep
                    expanding. On the other, the environmental degradation is caused in the rural life due to
                    indiscriminate collection of firewood, overgrazing and depletion of other natural resources.</div>
                <br>
                    <div id="box4">Industrialization coupled with the development of the means of
                    transport and communication has not only polluted the environment, but also has led to the
                    shrinking of the natural resources. Both ways, the loss is really heavy. Increasing level of
                    heat fluxes, carbon dioxide and particulate, radioactive nuclear wastes and the like create
                    environment hazards. On the other hand, the consumption of conventional source of energy
                    leads to the loss of natural resource. We are building a world without caring for future
                    generations.</div>

        <h2 id="Awareness about Environmental Protection">Awareness about Environmental Protection
        </h2>
        <div id="box2">
            In the past two decades, environment has attracted the attention of decision makers,
scientists and even laymen in many parts of the world. They are becoming increasingly
conscious of issues such as famines, droughts, floods, scarcity of fuel, firewood and fodder,
pollution of air and water, problems of hazardous chemicals and radiation, depletion of
natural resources, extinction of wildlife and dangers to flora and fauna. People are now
aware of the need to protect the natural environmental resources of air, water, soil and
plant life that constitute the natural capital on which man depends.
The environmental issues are important because the absence of their solutions is more
horrible. Unless environmental issues are not solved or not taken care of the coming
generations may find earth worth not living. The need of the planet and the needs of the
person have become one.</div>
<br>
<div id="box3">There is no denying the fact that environment has to be protected and conserved so to
    make future life possible. Indeed, man's needs are increasing and accordingly the
    environment is also being altered, indeed, nature's capacity is too accommodating and too
    regenerative yet there is a limit to nature's capacity, especially when pressure of exploding
    population and technology keep mounting. What is required is the sustenance, conservation
    and improvement of the changing and fragile environment.</div><a href="#home" class="btn">HOME</a>
    <br>
    <h2 id="The Concept of Sustainable Development">The Concept of Sustainable Development</h2>
    
    <div id=box>
        The world commission on environment and development (the Brundtland commission)
submitted its report entitled “Our common future’ in 1987. This report highlighted and
popularised the concept of 'sustainable development'. Sustainable development has been
defined on meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the need of
future generations. All developmental activities involve some amount of environmental
degradation. What is required is to take into account the damage to environment as a
result of development, and strike a balance between development and environmental
protection. The aim should be to achieve sustainable levels of people's welfare and
development. The primary concern is how many people can ultimately be supported by
environment and at what level of quality of life.</div>
<br>
<div id="box4">The mainstream greens scholars like Carr, Brown, Dala, Schumacher. Does not make
    sense and others, all lay stress on "sustainability" of environment together with development.
    The emphasis of the mainstream green' are not on pollution, but on (1) energy and its
    resource may be renewed, and be kept renewing, (2) the waste be changed into
    raw-material, raw-material into waste, waste into raw- material: recycling of waste into
    raw-material; (3) gross national product and its growth targets need not be sought, but
    what should be sought is the satisfaction of real human needs'. The greens say that growth
    means cancer, a cancer that threatens to spread worldwide, and destroy all life. They accept industry if it is on small scale and is for purpose of self-sufficiency. They advocate
    extensive decentralization.</div>

>> Conserve the biotic diversity in the country by creating nature reserves and sanctuaries
for specific habitats such as mountains, rain forests, pastures, deserts, wet lands,
lakes, beaches, mangroves, estuaries, lagoons and island. <br>
>> Safeguard the environment within the national maritime Exclusive Economic Zone. <br>
>> Evolve environmental norms and establish effective mechanism for monitoring
surveillance and collection and dissemination of information. <br>

    <h2 id="GM">Some Measures taken by Indian Government to Check
        Environmental Pollution
        </h2>
        <div id="box3">
           <h3> Environmental Courts</h3>Special courts are being set up to ensure speedy justice of
the poor against factories that pollute the Environment.<br>
<h3>Environment Friendly Products</h3>The government is setting stringent standards
for all products in the market. Those, which meet these standards of production and
performance will be given the label of excellence like the ISI mark.<br>
<h3>Unleading Of Petrol</h3> Refineries are being persuaded to make their petrol lead
free. Indian petrol has the highest lead content, which creates major pollution through
automobiles.
<br>
<h3>Ban On Harmful Pesticides</h3>Eight chemical pesticides, of which DDT, BHC,
Aldrin and Malathion are the main culprits have been isolated. There are now plans
to replace them with safe biopesticides.
<br>
<h3>National Waste Management Council</h3>The main task is to convert 40 million
tones of flyash, that lie as a mountain near thermal power plants into bricks, city
garbage into energy and sewage into fertilizer.<br>
<h3>Pollution By Motor Vehicles</h3>Anti-pollution measures against motor vehicles are
being strictly enforced. Vehicles not adhering to the standards prescribed are fined
heavily and may even be asked to be off the road.<br>
<h3>Hotel Near Sea Shore</h3>Action has been taken against a large number of hotels
which encroach beaches in flagrant violation of laws.<br>
<h3>National River Action Plan</h3>The proposal is to set up a National river authority
which will plan policy for water use and waste management at the national level.
<br>
<h3>Solar Energy Commission</h3>  Since the energy sector is the major polluter, the idea
is to create decentralized energy at the village level, instead of multiplying the
mainstream producer<br>
<h3>No Smoking In Public Places</h3> A ban is proposed on smoking in public places. The
Delhi government has taken a lead in this direction.
