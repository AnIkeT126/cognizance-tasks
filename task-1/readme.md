## PROGRAMMING 

**QUESTION**
An elephant decided to visit his friend. It turned out that the elephant's house is located at point ​ 0
and his friend's house is located at point x (>0) of the coordinate line. In one step the elephant
can move  1, 2, 3, 4 or 5  positions forward. Determine, what is the minimum number of steps he
needs to make in order to get to his friend's house.

 **Input**
The first line of the input contains an integer x  (1 ≤ x ≤ 1 000 000) — The coordinate of the friend's house.

**Expected Output**
Print the minimum number of steps that the elephant needs to make to get from

As I already knew about basic programming and c++ so I didn't had much trouble in doing this task. A simple dry run made it much easy for me.
